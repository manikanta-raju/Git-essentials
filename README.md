# Git-essentials

Welcome to Git Essentials, your go-to repo to understand Git in the most chill and simple way possible

What is Git?
Git is like a time machine for your code. It helps you save, track, and go back to any version of your project.
So if your code breaks no worries, just rewind

Why Use Git?
Keeps history of your changes
Helps you collaborate with others
Backs up your work safely
Makes you look like a pro dev

Git in Real Life
Imagine:
You're working on a project, and Git is your notebook. Each time you make a change, you save a new page (commit).
You can go back to any page whenever you want no eraser needed!

Summary
Git Control + Safety + Collaboration Use it. Break things. Fix them. Repeat.

The name Git was chosen by Linus Torvalds (the same guy who made Linux).
"Git" is British slang for "unpleasant person" he was joking about himself
